  <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). My academic journey has given me a deep appreciation for logic, problem-solving, and creativity — which are the very same skills I enjoy applying in both mystery shows and cooking! Whether it’s writing code to solve a real-world problem or decoding a suspenseful storyline, I find joy in thinking critically and exploring new ideas.</p>
